# Continuous Deployment Strategies: Push vs. Pull Deployment

## Overview
This document outlines two primary deployment strategies used in Kubernetes environments: **Push Deployment** (Jenkins-based) and **Pull Deployment** (ArgoCD-based, following GitOps principles). 

## Push Deployment (Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline)
Push deployment involves triggering a CI/CD pipeline when a change is pushed to the repository. The deployment process includes the following steps:

1. **GitHub Push Event** â†’ Triggers the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **CI Phase**:
   - Install dependencies.
   - Build the application.
   - Create a Docker image.
   - Push the image to a container registry.
3. **CD Phase**:
   - Authenticate with the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Apply the required configuration files.
   - Use `kubectl` to update the cluster.
   - Pull and deploy the latest Docker image from the registry.

This method **pushes** changes from the pipeline to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Pull Deployment (GitOps with ArgoCD)
In contrast, **pull deployment** follows GitOps principles, where changes are automatically synchronized with the cluster.

### How It Works:
1. The **CI phase** completes, generating artifacts (e.g., manifests, Docker images).
2. Inside the Kubernetes cluster, **ArgoCD** continuously monitors a mapped GitHub repository.
3. ArgoCD:
   - Compares the **desired state** (GitHub repository) with the **current state** (Kubernetes cluster).
   - Detects changes in the repository.
   - Automatically pulls and deploys the latest configurations and images to match the desired state.

This method ensures **declarative and automated deployments**, eliminating the need for manual CD steps.

## Summary
| Deployment Type | Tool Used | Process |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| **Push Deployment** | Jenkins | Pipeline actively pushes changes to the cluster. |
| **Pull Deployment** | ArgoCD (GitOps) | Cluster continuously pulls and syncs changes from Git. |

GitOps-based **pull deployment** is preferred for **automated, version-controlled, and declarative** Kubernetes deployments, reducing manual intervention and improving reliability.
